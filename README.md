# calcy-odin
A calculator project to implement the lessons learnt in the odin project
## lessons learnt:
//one function one job: follow this very strictly
//find out the core loop where you can update values(point of change)
//for any repeated code(expressions or block of statements) create variables and functions
//create visual clues to keep track of logic and stuff, like enabled and disabled
